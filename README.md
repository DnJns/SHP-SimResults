# SHP-SimResults. A library of solar and heat pump system simulation results.

`SHP-SimResults` is a library of solar and heat pump system simulation results as summary of the performed TRNSYS simulations within the PhD thesis *Model-based Analysis of Solar and Heat Pump Systems for the Energy Supply of Residential Buildings* (Jonas, 2023; currently under review).

## Basic idea
The main idea behind `SHP-SimResults` is to make the data and results of the simulations performed as part of the PhD thesis *Model-based Analysis of Solar and Heat Pump Systems for the Energy Supply of Residential Buildings* (Jonas, 2023; currently under review) available for further research and evaluation, as the multitude of simulation results required a restriction of the KPIs evaluated within the PhD work focusing on a selection of main performance figures. For further details including descriptions of the used models and boundary conditions, the KPIs and the performed simulations see (Jonas, 2023).
